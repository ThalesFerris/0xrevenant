The Red-Ops SOC Toolkit is an integrated framework designed to bridge the gap between offensive security testing and defensive monitoring. Built for SOC analysts and Red Teamers, this repository provides a modular suite of tools for automated log normalization, behavioral threat detection, and adversary emulation. By utilizing a "Detection as Code" approach, it enables teams to validate their security stack against real-world TTPs, refine alert fidelity, and automate the triage of complex telemetry.
